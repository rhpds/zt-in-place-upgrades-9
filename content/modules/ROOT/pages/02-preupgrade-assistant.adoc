== Running the pre-upgrade assistant and resolving issues

Built into the leapp tool is a utility that collects data about the
system, assesses upgradability, and generates a pre-upgrade report. On
your lab system, perform the pre-upgrade test: (This process will take a
couple minutes.)

[source,bash,run]
----
leapp preupgrade --target 9.6
----

Notice how the upgrade was "`inhibited`" because the preupgrade
assistant requires your input on one or more issues before it will
safely proceed. Take a look at the first entry in the `+leapp-report+`
file in the log directory:

[source,bash,run]
----
cat /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt
----

One of the major security changes in RHEL 9 was that the `+root+`
account is no longer allowed to login via SSH by default.
